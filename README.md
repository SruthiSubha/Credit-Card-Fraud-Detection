# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud generally happens when the card was stolen for any of the unauthorized purposes or even when the fraudster uses the credit card information for his use. In the present world, we are facing a lot of credit card problems. To detect the fraudulent activities the credit card fraud detection system was introduced. This project aims to focus mainly on machine learning algorithms. The algorithms used are knn algorithm, naive bayes, decision tree algorithm out of which decision tree algorithm gave good accuracy when compared with other algorithms,
